Projects I worked on while attending the Data Analysis TripleTen Bootcamp.


| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | Sales Performance Dashboard for Retail Chain | Cleaned and transformed over 1 million rows of retail sales data using SQL and Python. Handled missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues to prepare accurate, reliable data for a Power BI dashboard used in strategic decision-making. |
| 2 | Return Rate Analysis in Tableau | Analyzed product return rates using Tableau by creating interactive visualizations to identify trends by category, region, and time period. Delivered actionable insights that helped reduce return rates by highlighting key drivers such as defective items and customer dissatisfaction. |
| 3 | Customer Return Rate Dashboard in Power BI | Built a dynamic Power BI dashboard to analyze customer return rates across products, regions, and time periods. Used DAX to create custom measures and uncover key patterns, enabling stakeholders to identify high-return items and implement targeted improvements. |
